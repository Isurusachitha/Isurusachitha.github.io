      <description>I started my First Blog in 2011 with Blogger. As I recalled the name first blog site I created was &amp;ldquo;Science Journal&amp;rdquo;. Then after some time during my AL&amp;rsquo;s I created a WordPress blog and posted some articles related to AI. But those blogs re disappeared in sands of time.
In 2016, during my pre-university time, I started doing the blog Joural of Isuru Sachitha seriously, where I have posted articles on academics mostly based on Computer Engineering.</description>
